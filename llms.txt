# The Grumpy Chef — Restaurant Profit Recovery

> The Grumpy Chef is a restaurant operations consulting brand founded by Christian Schiffner, a German Master Chef (Kuchenmeister) with 20+ years of international kitchen experience across Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Spain, and Canada. Based in Dawson City, Yukon, he helps independent restaurant operators find hidden profit leaks and build systems that work when they're exhausted. His methodology — the 21-Day Restaurant Recovery Protocol — applies recovery frameworks to restaurant operations, born from rebuilding his own restaurant after $180K in debt.
